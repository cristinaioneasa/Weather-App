# Weather-App
## About
I have implemented a weather application that runs on localhost. The application is linked to a Weather API, with the data being true and up-to-date. Users can view weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind, visibility, pressure, as well as location data such as longitude and latitude. Additionally, users can compare the temperature and weather conditions (cloudy, rainy, snowy, clear sky) in two cities.

## Use cases:
The user searches for a city and weather details are displayed, such as temperature, wind, humidity, the weather condition (clear sky, cloudy, rain, snow). Then the user has the option to see more details about it or to compare the weather with another city. Below are images of the three use cases.

### 3. Compare 2 cities:
### It can be seen that the icon changes depending on the weather.

### In the unfortunate case that the user enters a city that does not exist, it is announced that the name is invalid.

### The application can also be opened on a mobile phone. For example, on a Samsung A51 it will look like this:
